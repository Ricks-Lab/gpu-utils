## Installation

There are 4 methods of installation available and summarized here:
* [Repository](#repository-installation) - This approach is recommended for those interested in contributing to the project or helping to troubleshoot an issue in realtime with the developer. This type of installation can exist along with any of the other installation type.
* [PyPI](#pypi-installation) - Meant for users wanting to run the very latest version.  All **PATCH** level versions are released here first.  This install method is also meant for users not on a Debian distribution.
* [Rickslab.com Debian](#rickslabcom-debian-installation) - Lags the PyPI release in order to assure robustness. May not include every **PATCH** version.
* [Official Debian](#official-debian-package-installation) - Only **MAJOR/MINOR** releases.  This works for releases of Ubuntu 22.04 or Bullseye 11.3 or later.

### Repository Installation

For a developer/contributor to the project, it is expected that you duplicate the development environment
using a virtual environment. So far, my development activities for this project have used python3.6. 
The following are details on setting up a virtual environment with python3.6:

```shell
sudo apt install -y python3.6-venv
sudo apt install -y python3.6-dev
```

Clone the repository from GitHub with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils.git
cd gpu-utils
```

Initialize your *rickslab-gpu-utils-env* if it is your first time to use it. From the project root directory, execute:

```shell
python3.6 -m venv rickslab-gpu-utils-env
source rickslab-gpu-utils-env/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-venv.txt
```

On newer systems, I have found that I get a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`, even though `numpy` was
successfully installed in the newly created virtual environment.  To resolve this, I deactivated the venv and installed
it for the system instance of python.  When back in the venv, the issue is resolved.  No idea why this is happening.

You then run the desired commands by specifying the full path: `./gpu-ls`

### PyPI Installation

First, remove any previous Debian package and any ricks-amdgpu-utils PyPI installations:

```shell
sudo apt purge rickslab-gpu-utils
sudo apt purge ricks-amdgpu-utils
sudo apt autoremove
pip3 uninstall ricks-amdgpu-utils
```

Install the latest package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rickslab-gpu-utils/) with the following
commands:

```shell
pip3 install rickslab-gpu-utils
```

Or, use the pip upgrade option if you have already installed a previous version:

```shell
pip3 install rickslab-gpu-utils -U
```

You may need to open a new terminal window in order for the path to the utilities to be set.

### Rickslab.com Debian Installation

First, remove any previous PyPI installation and exit that terminal.  If you
also have a Debian installed version, the pip uninstall will likely fail,
unless you remove the Debian package first.  You can skip this step if you
are certain no other install types are still installed:

```shell
sudo apt purge rickslab-gpu-utils
sudo apt purge ricks-amdgpu-utils
sudo apt autoremove
pip uninstall rickslab-gpu-utils
exit
```

If you had previously (before 3.7.6) installed from rickslab.com, you should
delete the key from the apt keyring:

```shell
sudo apt-key del C98B8839
```

Next, add the *rickslab-gpu-utils* repository:

```shell
wget -q -O - https://debian.rickslab.com/PUBLIC.KEY | sudo gpg --dearmour -o /usr/share/keyrings/rickslab-agent.gpg

echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rickslab-agent.gpg] https://debian.rickslab.com/gpu-utils/ eddore main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rickslab-gpu-utils.list

sudo apt update
```

Then install the package with apt:

```shell
sudo apt install rickslab-gpu-utils
```

If you decide to no longer use this type of install, you can remove
rickslab-gpu-utils from the system repository list by executing the following:

```shell
echo '' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rickslab-gpu-utils.list
```

### Official Debian Package Installation

First you should verify the availability of the package by distribution with the following command:
```shell
rmadison rickslab-gpu-utils
```

Current package availability is as follows:
```text
 rickslab-gpu-utils | 3.6.0-2 | jammy/universe   | source, all
 rickslab-gpu-utils | 3.6.0-3 | kinetic/universe | source, all
 rickslab-gpu-utils | 3.8.0-1 | lunar/universe   | source, all
 rickslab-gpu-utils | 3.8.0-1 | mantic/universe  | source, all
```

Then remove any previous PyPI installation and exit that terminal.  If you also
have a Debian installed versions, the pip uninstall will likely fail, unless you
remove the Debian package first. You can skip this step if you are certain no
over install types have been installed:

```shell
sudo apt purge ricks-amdgpu-utils
sudo apt purge rickslab-gpu-utils
sudo apt autoremove
pip uninstall rickslab-gpu-utils
exit
```


If you had previously added https://debian.rickslab.com/gpu-utils/ as a repository
source, then you will need to remove this in order to download from the official
debian repository.  This can be accomplished with the following shell command:

```shell
echo '' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rickslab-gpu-utils.list
```

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rickslab-gpu-utils
```


## Getting Started

First, this set of utilities is written and tested with Python3.6.  If you are using an older
version, you will likely see syntax errors.  If you are encountering problems, then execute:

```shell
gpu-chk
```

This should display a message indicating any Python or Kernel incompatibilities. In order to
get maximum capability of these utilities, you should be running with a kernel that provides
support of the GPUs you have installed.  If using AMD GPUs, installing the latest **amdgpu**
driver or **ROCm** release, may provide additional capabilities. If you have Nvidia GPUs
installed, you should have **nvidia.smi** installed in order for the utility reading of the
cards to be possible.  Writing to GPUs is currently only possible for AMD GPUs, and only
with compatible cards.  Modifying AMD GPU properties requires that the AMD ppfeaturemask
be set to 0xfffd7fff. This can be accomplished by adding `amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff`
to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` value in `/etc/default/grub` and executing `sudo update-grub`:

I found a more specific way of determining the ppfeaturemask value that sets only the required
bits.  I have not yet tested on enough systems to know it is robust:

```shell
printf 'amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0x%x\n' "$(($(cat /sys/module/amdgpu/parameters/ppfeaturemask) | 0x4000))"
```

```shell
cd /etc/default
sudo vi grub
```

Modify to include the featuremask as follows:

```shell
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff"
```

After saving, update grub:

```shell
sudo update-grub
```

and then reboot.

If you have Nvidia GPUs installed, you will need to have nvidia-smi installed.

## Using gpu-ls

After getting your system setup to support **rickslab-gpu-utils**, it is best to verify functionality by
listing your GPU details with the *gpu-ls* command.  The utility will use the system `lspci` command
to identify all installed GPUs.  The utility will also verify system setup/configuration for read, write,
and compute capability.  Additional performance/configuration details are read from the GPU for compatible
GPUs.  Example of the output is as follows:

```

If everything is working fine, you should see no warning or errors.  The listing utility
also has other command line options:

```
usage: gpu-ls [-h] [--about] [--long | --short | --table | --raw]
              [--pstates | --ppm | --features | --clinfo] [--verbose]
              [--force_all] [--no_markup] [--no_fan] [--debug]

optional arguments:
       -h, --help   show this help message and exit
       --about      README
       --long       Long listing of GPU details. Includes pstate, ppm, features,
                    and clinfo.
       --short      Short listing of basic GPU details
       --table      Current status of readable GPUs
       --raw        Show all raw GPU sensor data
       --pstates    Output pstate tables instead of GPU details
       --ppm        Output power/performance mode tables instead of GPU details
       --features   Output amdgpu Feature table instead of GPU details
       --clinfo     Include openCL with card details
       --verbose    Display informational message of GPU util progress
       --force_all  Force attempt to read all sensors
       --no_markup  Do not format ls output
       --no_fan     Do not include fan setting options
       -d, --debug  Debug logger output
```

The *--clinfo* option will make a call to clinfo, if it is installed, and list openCL parameters
along with the basic parameters.  The benefit of running this in *gpu-ls* is that the tool
uses the PCIe slot id to associate clinfo results with the appropriate GPU in the listing.

If you have the clinfo package installed, then the command *gpu-ls --clinfo* should provide something
like this at the end of each card's listing (example shown for an AMD GPU):

## GPU Type Dependent Behavior

GPU capability and compatibility varies over the various vendors and generations of hardware.  In
order to manage this variability, **rickslab-gpu-utils** must classify each installed GPU by its vendor
and type.  So far, valid types are as follows:

* **Undefined** - This is the default assigned type, before a valid type can be determined.
* **Unsupported** - This is the type assigned for cards which have no capability of reading beyond basic parameters typical of PCIe devices.
* **Supported** - This is the type assigned for basic readability, including *nvidia-smi* readabile GPUs.
* **Legacy** - Applies to legacy AMD GPUs with very basic parameters available to read. (pre-HD7)
* **LegacyAPU** - Applies to older AMD integrated graphics with very few parameters available. (Ontario)
* **APU** - Applies to AMD integrated graphics with limited parameters available. (Carizzo - Renoir)
* **PStatesNE** - Applies to AMD GPUs with most parameters available, but Pstates not writeable. (HD7 series)
* **PStates** - Applies to modern AMD GPUs with writeable Pstates. (R9 series thr RX-Vega)
* **CurvePts** - Applies to latest generation AMD GPUs that use AVFS curves instead of Pstates. (Vega20 and newer)

With the *gpu-ls* tool, you can determine the type of your installed GPUs. Here are examples of
relevant lines from the output for different types of GPUs:

```
Decoded Device ID: 8th Gen Core Processor Gaussian Mixture Model [Intel CPU with integrated graphics]
GPU Type: Unsupported

Decoded Device ID: GM107 [GeForce GTX 750]
GPU Type: Supported

Decoded Device ID: R9 290X DirectCU II
GPU Type: PStatesNE

Decoded Device ID: RX Vega64
GPU Type: PStates

Decoded Device ID: Radeon VII
GPU Type: CurvePts

Decoded Device ID: Radeon RX 5600 XT
GPU Type: CurvePts
```

Monitor and Control utilities will differ between these types:

* For **Undefined** and **Unsupported** types, only generic PCIe parameters are available.  These types are
considered unreadable, unwritable, and as having no compute capability.
* For **Supported** types have the most basic level of readability.  This includes NV cards with nvidia-smi support.
* For **Legacy** and **APU**, only basic and limited respectively are readable.
* For **Pstates** and **PstatesNE** type GPUs, pstate details are readable, but for **PstatesNE** they are not
writable. For type **Pstates** pstate Voltages/Frequencies as well as pstate masking can be specified.
* The **CurvePts** type applies to modern (Vega20 and later) AMD GPUs that use AVFS instead of Pstates for
performance control.  These have the highest degree of read/write capability. The SCLK and MCLK curve end points
can be controlled, which has the effect of over/under clocking/voltage.  You are also able to modify the three
points that define the Vddc-SCLK curve. I have not attempted to OC the card yet, but I assume redefining the 3rd
point would be the best approach.  For underclocking, lowering the SCLK end point is effective.  I don't see a
curve defined for memory clock on the Radeon VII, so setting memory clock vs. voltage doesn't seem possible at
this time.  There also appears to be an inconsistency in the defined voltage ranges for curve points and actual
default settings. 

Below is a plot of what I extracted for the Frequency vs Voltage curves of the RX Vega64 and the Radeon VII.

## Using gpu-mon

By default, *gpu-mon* will display a text based table in the current terminal window that updates
every sleep duration, in seconds, as defined by *--sleep N* or 2 seconds by default. If you are using
water cooling, you can use the *--no_fans* to remove fan monitoring functionality.

```

The fields are the same as the GUI version of the display, available with the *--gui* option.

![](gpu-monitor-gui_scrshot.png)

The first row gives the card number for each GPU.  This number is the integer used by the driver for each GPU.  Most
fields are self describing.  The Power Cap field is especially useful in managing compute power efficiency, and
lowering the cap can result in more level loading and overall lower power usage for little compromise in performance. 
The Energy field is a derived metric that accumulates GPU energy usage, in kWh, consumed since the monitor started.
Note that total card power usage may be more than reported GPU power usage.  Energy is calculated as the product of
the latest power reading and the elapsed time since the last power reading. 

The P-states in the table for **CurvePts** type GPU are an indication of frequency vs. voltage curves.
Setting P-states to control the GPU is no longer relevant for this type, but these concepts are used in
reading current states.

The Perf Mode field gives the current power performance mode, which may be modified in with *gpu-pac*.  These
modes affect the how frequency and voltage are managed versus loading.  This is a very important parameter when
managing compute performance.

Executing *gpu-mon* with the *--plot* option will display a continuously updating plot of the critical
GPU parameters.
![](gpu-plot_scrshot.png)

Having an *gpu-mon* Gtx window open at startup may be useful if you run GPU compute projects that autostart
and you need to quickly confirm that *gpu-pac* bash scripts ran as expected at startup
(see [Using gpu-pac](#using-gpu-pac)). You can have *gpu-mon --gui* automatically launch at startup
or upon reboot by using the startup utility for your distribution. In Ubuntu, for example, open *Startup Applications
Preferences* app, then in the Preferences window select *Add* and use something like this in the command field:

```shell
/usr/bin/python3 /home/<user>/Desktop/rickslab-gpu-utils/gpu-mon --gui
```

where `/rickslab-gpu-utils` may be a soft link to your current distribution directory. This startup approach does not
work for the default Terminal text execution of *gpu-mon*. 

## Using gpu-plot

In addition to being called from *gpu-mon* with the *--plot* option, *gpu-plot* may be ran as a standalone
utility.  Just execute *gpu-plot --sleep N* and the plot will update at the defined interval.  It is not
recommended to run both the monitor with an independently executed plot, as it will result in twice as many reads
from the driver files.  Once the plots are displayed, individual items on the plot can be toggled by selecting the
named button on the plot display.

The *--stdin* option is used by *gpu-mon --plot* in its execution of *gpu-plot*.  This option along
with *--simlog* option can be used to simulate a plot output using a log file generated by *gpu-mon --log*. 
I use this feature when troubleshooting problems from other users, but it may also be useful in benchmarking
performance.  An example of the command line for this is as follows:

```shell
cat log_monitor_0421_081038.txt | gpu-plot --stdin --simlog
```

## Using gpu-pac

By default, *gpu-pac* will open a Gtk based GUI to allow the user to modify GPU performance parameters.  I strongly
suggest that you completely understand the implications of changing any of the performance settings before you use
this utility.  As per the terms of the GNU General Public License that covers this project, there is no warranty on
the usability of these tools.  Any use of this tool is at your own risk.

To help you manage the risk in using this tool, two modes are provided to modify GPU parameters.  By default, a bash
file is created that you can review and execute to implement the desired changes.  Here is an example of that file:

```

When you execute *gpu-pac*, you will notice a message bar at the bottom of the interface.  By default, it informs
you of the mode you are running in.  By default, the operation mode is to create a bash file, but with the
*--execute_pac* (or *--execute*) command line option, the bash file will be automatically executed and then deleted. 
The message bar will indicate this status.  Because the driver files are writable only by root, the commands to
write configuration settings are executed with sudo.  The message bar will display in red when credentials are
pending.  Once executed, a yellow message will remind you to check the state of the gpu with *gpu-mon*.  I
suggest using the monitor routine when executing pac to see and confirm the changes in real-time.

The command line option *--force_write* will result in all configuration parameters to be written to the bash file. 
The default behavior since v2.4.0 is to write only changes.  The *--force_write* is useful for creating a bash file
that can be execute to set your cards to a known state. As an example, you could use such a file to configure your
GPUs on boot up (see [Running Startup PAC Bash Files](#running-startup-pac-bash-files)).

### The gpu-pac interface for Type PStates and Type CurvePts cards

![](gpu-pac_scrshot.png)

In the interface, you will notice entry fields for indicating new values for specific parameters.  In most cases, the
values in these fields will be the current values, but in the case of P-state masks, it will show the default value
instead of the current value.  If you know how to obtain the current value, please let me know!

Note that when a PAC bash file is executed either manually or automatically, the resulting fan PWM (% speed) may
be slightly different from what you see in the Fan PWM entry field.  The direction and magnitude of differences
between expected and realized fan speeds can depend on card model.  You will need to experiment with different
settings to determine how it works with your card.  I recommend running these experimental settings when the GPU
is not under load.  If you know the cause of the differences between entered and final fan PWM values, let me know. 

Changes made with *gpu-pac* do not persist through a system reboot. To reestablish desired GPU settings after a
reboot, either re-enter them using *gpu-pac* or *gpu-pac --execute*, or execute a previously saved bash file.
*gpu-pac* bash files must retain their originally assigned file name to run properly.
See [Running Startup PAC Bash Files](#running-startup-pac-bash-files) for how to run PAC bash
scripts automatically at system startup.

For Type **Pstates** cards, while changes to power caps and fan speeds can be made while the GPU is under load, for
*gpu-pac* to work properly, other changes may require that the GPU not be under load, *i.e.*, that sclk
P-state and mclk P-state are 0. Possible consequences with making changes under load is that the GPU become
stuck in a 0 P-state or that the entire system becomes slow to respond, where a reboot will be needed to restore
full GPU functions. Note that when you change a P-state mask, default mask values will reappear in the field
after Save, but your specified changes will have been implemented on the card and show up in *gpu-mon*.
Some changes may not persist when a card has a connected display. When changing P-state MHz or mV, the desired
P-state mask, if different from default (no masking), will have to be re-entered for clock or voltage changes to
be applied. Again, save PAC changes to clocks, voltages, or masks only when the GPU is at resting state (state 0).

For Type **CurvePts** cards, although changes to P-state masks cannot be made through *gpu-pac*, changes to all
other fields can be made on-the-fly while the card is under load.

Some basic error checking is done before writing, but I suggest you be very certain of all entries before you save
changes to the GPU.  You should always confirm your changes with *gpu-mon*.

## Updating the PCI ID decode file 

In determining the GPU display name, **rickslab-gpu-utils** will examine two sources.  The output of 
`lspci -k -s nn:nn.n` is used to generate a complete name, and an algorithm is used to generate a shortened
version.  From the driver files, a set of files (vendor, device, subsystem_vendor, subsystem_device) contain
4 parts of the Device ID are read and used to extract a GPU model name from system pci.ids file which is
sourced from [https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/](https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/) where a comprehensive list is maintained.  The
system file can be updated from the original source with the command:

```
sudo update-pciids
```

If your GPU is not listed in the extract, the pci.id website has an interface to allow the user to request an
addition to the master list.  

## Optimizing Compute Performance-Power

The **rickslab-gpu-utils** tools can be used to optimize performance vs. power for compute workloads by leveraging
its ability to measure power and control relevant GPU settings.  This flexibility allows one to execute a
DOE to measure the effect of GPU settings on the performance in executing specific workloads.  In SETI@Home
performance, the Energy feature has also been built into [benchMT](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/benchMT) to
benchmark power and execution times for various work units.  This, combined with the log file produced with
*gpu-mon --gui --log*, may be useful in optimizing performance.

## Running Startup PAC Bash Files

If you set your system to run *gpu-pac* bash scripts automatically, as described in this section, note that
changes in your hardware or graphic drivers may cause potentially serious problems with GPU settings unless new
PAC bash files are generated following the changes. Review the [Using gpu-pac](#using-gpu-pac) section
before proceeding.

One approach is to execute PAC bash scripts as a systemd startup service. From *gpu-pac --force_write*, set your
optimal configurations for each GPU, then Save All. You may need to change ownership to root of each card's bash
file: `sudo chown root pac_writer*.sh`

For each bash file, you could create a symlink (soft link) that corresponds to the card number referenced in each
linked bash file, using simple descriptive names, *e.g.*, pac_writer_card1, pac_writer_card2, *etc.*. These links are
optional, but can make management of new or edited startup bash files easier. Links are used in the startup service
example, below. Don't forget to reform the link(s) each time a new PAC bash file is written for a card. 
 
Next, create a .service file named something like, gpu-pac-startup.service and give it the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=run at boot rickslab-gpu-utils PAC bash scripts

[Service]
Type=oneshot

ExecStart=/home/<user>/pac_writer_card0
ExecStart=/home/<user>/pac_writer_card1
ExecStart=/home/<user>/pac_writer_card2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The Type=oneshot service allows use of more than one ExecStart.  In this example, three bash files are used for
two cards, where two alternative files are used for one card that the system may recognize as either card0 or
card1; see further below for an explanation. 

Once your .service file is set up, execute the following commands:

```
sudo chown root:root gpu-pac-startup.service 
sudo mv gpu-pac-startup.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/gpu-pac-startup.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable gpu-pac-startup.service

The last command should produce a terminal stdout like this:
`Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/gpu-pac-startup.service → /etc/systemd/system/gpu-pac-startup.service.`

On the next reboot or restart, the GPU(s) will be set with the PAC run parameters. If you want to test the bash
script(s) before rebooting, run: `~$ sudo systemctl start gpu-pac-startup.service`. 

If you have a Type PStates card where some PAC parameters can't be changed when it is under load, you will want
to make sure that the PAC bash script executes before the card begins computing. If you have a *boinc-client* that
automatically runs on startup, for example, then consider delaying it for 20 seconds using the cc_config.xml
option *<start_delay>30</start_delay>*.

One or more card numbers that are assigned by amdgpu drivers may change following a system or driver
update and restart. With subsequent updates or restarts, a card can switch back to its original number. When a
switch occurs, the bash file written for a previous card number will still be read at startup, but will have no
effect, causing the renumbered card to run at its default settings. To deal with this possibility, you can create
an alternative PAC bash file after a renumbering event and add these alternative files in your systemd service.
You will probably just need two alternative bash files for a card that is subject to reindexing. A card's
number is shown by *gpu-ls* and also appears in *gpu-mon* and *gpu-plot*. A card's PCI IDs is listed
by *gpu-ls*. If you know what causes GPU card index switching, let me know.

You may find a card running at startup with default power limits and Fan PWM settings instead of what is prescribed
in its startup PAC bash file. If so, it may be that the card's hwmon# is different from what is hard coded in the
bash file, because the hwmon index for devices can also change upon reboot. To work around this, you can edit a
card's bash file to define hwmon# as a variable and modify the hwmon lines to use it. Here is an example for card1:

```
set -x
HWMON=$(ls /sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon/)
# Powercap Old: 120 New: 110 Min: 0 Max: 180
sudo sh -c "echo '1100000000' >  /sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon/$HWMON/power1_cap"
# Fan PWM Old:  44 New:  47 Min:  0 Max:  100
sudo sh -c "echo '1' >  /sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon/$HWMON/pwm1_enable"
sudo sh -c "echo '119' >  /sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon/$HWMON/pwm1"
```
