## Getting Started
First, this set of utils is written and tested with Python3.6.  If you are using and older
version, you will likely see syntax errors.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to catch a
syntax error, so if you have issues, just execute:
```
./amdgpu-chk
```
and it should display a message indicating any Python or Kernel incompatibilities.  You will
also notice that there is a minimum version of the Kernel that supports these features, but be
warned, I have only tested it with 4.15. There have been amdgpu features implemented over time
that spans many releases of the kernel, so your experience in using these utilities with older 
kernels may not be ideal.

In order to use any of these utilities, you must have the *amdgpu* open source driver
package installed. You can check with the following command:
```
dpkg -l amdgpu
```

You also must set your linux machine to boot with the feature mask set to support the functionality
that these tools depend on.  Do do this, you must set amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffff7fff.  This
can be accomplished by adding amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffff7fff to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
value in /etc/default/grub and executing *sudo update-grub* as in the following example:
```
cd /etc/default
sudo vi grub
```
Modify to include the featuremask as follows:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffff7fff"
```
After saving, update grub:
```
sudo update-grub
```
and then reboot.

If you plan to use the GPU plot feature of amdgpu-monitor, you must first install the pandas and matplotlib modules.  For Ubuntu, use the following for the instalation:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pandas
sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
```


## Using amdgpu-ls
After getting your system setup to support amdgpu-utils, it is best to verify functionality by 
listing your GPU details with the *amdgpu-ls* command.  It first attempts to detect the version 
of amdgpu drivers you have installed and then check compatibility of installed AMD GPUs.  Its
default behavior is to list basic GPU details for all compatible cards:
```AMD Wattman features enabled: 0xffff7fff
amdgpu version: 18.50-725072
2 AMD GPUs detected, 2 may be compatible, checking...
2 are confirmed compatible.

If everything is working fine, you should see no warning or errors.  The listing utility
also has other command line options:
```usage: amdgpu-ls [-h] [--about] [--pstates] [--ppm] [--clinfo] [--no_fan] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --about      README
  --pstates    Output pstate tables instead of GPU details
  --ppm        Output power/performance mode tables instead of GPU details
  --clinfo     Include openCL with card details
  --no_fan     don't include fan setting options
  -d, --debug  Debug output
```

The *--clinfo* option will make a call to clinfo, if it is installed, and list these parameters
along with the basic parameters.  The benefit of running this in *amdgpu-ls* is that the tool
uses the PCIe slot id to associate clinfo results with the appropriate GPU in the listing.

The *--pstates* and *--ppm* options will display the P-State definition table and the power
performance mode table.
```
./amdgpu-ls --pstate --ppm

## GPU Type Dependent Behavior
AMD GPU's compatible with the amdgpu open source drivers are of 3 different types in terms of how frequency/voltage
is managed.  GPUs of Vega10 and earlier architecture rely on the definition of specific power states to determine
the clock frequency and voltage.  The GPU will operate at only the specific Frequency/Voltage states that are defined, 
and move between states based on power, temperature, and loading.  These GPU's are of type 1, if the p-state table
is readble and type 0 if it is not. For GPUs of Vega20 architecture or newer, it appears that Voltage/Frequency curves
are defined with 3 points on a Voltage vs. Frequency curve.  These GPU's are classified as type 2.

With the *amdgpu-ls* tool, you can determine if your card is of type 1 or 2. Here are the relevant lines from the 
output for and RX Vega64 GPU and the Radeon VII:
```
Decoded Device ID: R9 290X DirectCU II
GPU Frequency/Voltage Control Type: 0

Decoded Device ID: RX Vega64
GPU Frequency/Voltage Control Type: 1

Decoded Device ID: Radeon VII
GPU Frequency/Voltage Control Type: 2
```

Monitor and Control utilities will differ between the 3 types.
* For type 0, you can monitor the p-state details with monitor utilities, but you can NOT define p-states or set p-state masks.
* For type 1, you can monitor the p-state details with monitor utilities, and you can define p-states and set p-state masks.
* For Type 2, you can monitor current Clocks frequency and p-states, with latest amdgpu drivers.  The SCLK and MCLK curve end points can be controlled, which has the equivalent effect as p-state masking for Type 1 cards.  You are also able to modify the three points that define the Vddc-SCLK curve. I have not attempted to OC the card yet, but I assume redefining the 3rd pointwould be the best approach.  For underclocking, lowering the SCLK end point is effective.  I don't see a curve defined for memory clock on the Radeon VII, so setting memory clock vs. voltage doesn't seem possible at this time.  There also appears to be an inconsistency in the defined voltage ranges for curve points and actual default settings. 

Below is a plot of what I extracted for the Frequency vs Voltage curves of the RX Vega64 and the Radeon VII.

## Using amdgpu-monitor
By default, *amdgpu-monitor* will display a text based table in the current terminal window
that updates every sleep duration, in seconds, as defined by *--sleep N* or 2 seconds by default. If you are using
water cooling, you can us the *--no_fans* to remove fan functionality.

```
The fields are the same as the gui version of the display, available with the *--gui* option.
![](amdgpu-monitor_scrshot.png)

The first row gives the card number for each GPU.  This number is the integer used by the driver
for each GPU. Card0 will be the AMD card with the monitor connected. If the monitor is connected to a motherboard port using on-board (integrated) graphics, then AMD cards will be listed starting with card1 in the first PCIe slot. 

Most fields are self describing.  The Power Cap field is especially useful in managing
compute power efficiency and lowering the cap, which can result in more level loading and overall lower power
usage for little compromise in performance.  The Energy field is a derived metric that accumulates GPU 
energy usage, in kWh, consumed since the monitor started. Note that total card power usage may be more than reported GPU usage.  Energy is calculated as the product of the latest power reading and the elapsed time since the last power reading. 

You will notice that there are no clock frequencies or valid p-states for the Vega 20 card.  This is
due to a change in frequency vs voltage in this generation of GPUs.  The P-state table for Vega 20
is a definition of frequency vs. voltage curves.  I am not certain how to read current frequencies or 
modify curves, so these features are disabled in the utilities for Vega 20 and other GPU's that use this
approach.

The Perf Mode field gives the current power performance mode, which can be modified in with amdgpu-pac.
These modes affect the how frequency and voltage are managed versus loading.  Also a very important 
parameter when managing compute performance.

Executing *amdgpu-monitor* with the *--plot* option will display a continuously updating plot of the critical GPU parameters.
![](amdgpu-plot_scrshot.png)

## Using amdgpu-plot
In addition to being called from *amdgpu-monitor* with the *--plot* option, *amdgpu-plot* can be ran as a standalone utility.  Just execute *amdgpu-plot --sleep N* and the plot will update at the defined interval.  it is not recomended to run both the monitor with an independently executed plot, as it will result in twice as many reads from the driver files.  Once the plots are displayed, individual items on the plot can be toggled by selecting the named button on the plot display.  Currently, the plot module will eventually freeze, so it is not recomended to run for an extended period of time.  If you know of a solution to this problem, let me know.

## Using amdgpu-pac
By default, *amdgpu-pac* will open a Gtk based GUI to allow the user to modify GPU performance parameters.
I strongly suggest that you completely understand the implications of changing any of the performance 
settings before you use this utility.  As per the terms of the GNU General Public License that covers this
project, there is no warranty on the usability of these tools.  Any use of this tool is at your own risk.

To help you manage the risk in using this tool, there are 2 modes in which GPUs are written to.  By default,
a bash file is created that you can review and execute to implement the desired changes.  Here is an example
of that file:

When you execute *amdgpu-pac*, you will notice a message bar at the bottom of the interface.  
By default, it informs you of the mode you are running in.  By default, the operation mode is
to create a bash file, but with the *--execute_pac* (or *--execute*) command line option, the bash file will
be automatically executed and then deleted.  The message bar will indicate this status.  Since
the driver files are only writable by root, the commands to write configuration settings are executed
with sudo.  The message bar will have a red indicator that credentials are pending if that is the case.
Once executed, a yellow message will remind you to check the state of the gpu with *amdgpu-monitor*.
I suggest to use the monitor routine while you run pac in order to see the changes in real-time.

The command line option *--force_write* will result in all configuration parameters to be written to the bash file.  The default behavior since v2.4.0 is to only write changes.  The *--force_write* is useful for creating a bash file which can be execute to set your cards to a known state. As an example, you could use such a file to configure your GPUs on boot up.

### The amdgpu-pac interface for Type 1 cards
![](amdgpu-pac_type1.png)

### The amdgpu-pac interface for Type 2 cards
![](amdgpu-pac_type2.png)

In the interface, you will notice entry fields for indicating new values for specific parameters.  In
most cases, the values in these fields will be the current values, but in the case of P-state masks,
it will show the default value instead of the current value.  If you know how to obtain the current 
value, please let me know!

Note that when a PAC bash file is executed either manually or automatically, the resulting fan PWM (% speed) may be slightly different from what you see in the Fan PWM entry field.  Such changes to fan PWM may occur even though you did not specifically change Fan PWM and even if Fan PWM was previously set to dynamic (automatic, default) mode.  The direction and magnitude of differences between expected and realized fan speeds may depend on card model, so you will need to experiment with different settings to determine how it works with your card.  I recommend running these experimental settings when the GPU is not under load.  The cause of the differences between entered, or shown, and final fan PWM values is being investigated. 

Changes made with *amdgpu-pac* do not persist through a system reboot. To reestablish desired GPU settings after a reboot, either re-enter them using *amdgpu-pac* or *amdgpu-pac --execute*, or execute a previously saved bash file. *Amdgpu-pac* bash files must retain their originally assigned file name to run properly.

For Type 1 cards, while changes to power caps and fan speeds can be made while the GPU is under load, other changes may require that the GPU not be under load (be in 0 sclk and mclk P-state) for *amdgpu-pac* to work properly. Possible issues with making changes under load is that the GPU become stuck in a 0 P-state or that the entire system becomes slow to respond, where a reboot is needed to restore settings. Note that when you change a P-pstate mask, default mask values will reappear in the field after Save, but will have been implemented on the card and show up in *amdgpu-monitor*. Some changes may not be permanent when a card has a display connected. 

There is some very basic error checking done before writing, but I suggest you be very certain of
all entries before you save to the GPU.

## Using amdgpu-pciid
In determining the GPU display name, *amdgpu-utils* will examine 2 sources.  The output of *lscpi -k -s nn:nn.n* 
is used to generate a complete name and an algorithm is used to generate a shortened version.  From the driver 
files, a set of files (vendor, device, subsystem_vendor, subsystem_device) contain a 4 parts of the Device ID
are read and used to extract a GPU model name from a file retrieved from  [https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/]( https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/)
where a comprehensive list is maintained.  An AMD only extract from that source is included in this distribution.
The *amdgpu-pciid* tool can be used to manage the local extract.  Execute *amdgpu-pciid* to check if a newer version
is available and use *amdgpu-pciid --install* to replace the existing extract used by the utilities with an updated version.
If your GPU is not listed in the extract, the pci.id website has an interface to allow the user to request an addition
to the master list.  
```
usage: amdgpu-pciid [-h] [--about] [--download] [--install] [--force] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --about      README
  --download   download pci decode table from https://pci-
               ids.ucw.cz/v2.2/pci.ids
  --install    download, parse amd entries, and install a new decode file
  --force      force install of new pci.ids data even if revision is unchanged
  -d, --debug  Debug output
```

## Optimizing Compute Performance-Power
The *amdgpu-utils* tools can be used to optimize performance vs. power for compute workloads by leveraging
its ability to measure power and control relevant GPU settings.  This flexibility allows one to execute a
DOE to measure the effect of GPU settings on the performance in executing specific workloads.  In the case 
of SETI@Home performance, the Energy feature has also been built into [benchMT](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/benchMT) to benchmark power and execution times for various work units.  This combined with the log file produced with
*amdgpu-monitor --gui --log* can be useful in the optimization of performance.
