## rickslab-gpu-utils

A set of utilities for monitoring GPU performance and modifying control settings.

In order to get maximum capability of these utilities, you should be running with a kernel that
provides support of the GPUs you have installed.  If using AMD GPUs, installing the latest **amdgpu**
driver or **ROCm** package, may provide additional capabilities. If you have Nvidia GPUs installed,
you should have **nvidia-smi** installed in order for the utility reading of the cards to be
possible.  Writing to GPUs is currently only possible for compatible AMD GPUs on systems with
appropriate kernel version with the AMD ppfeaturemask set to enable this capability as described
[here](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md#getting-started).

## Installation

There are 4 methods of installation available and are summarized here:
If you get a key expired message during `apt update`, try updating the project PUBLIC.KEY with the 
following command:

```shell
wget -q -O - https://debian.rickslab.com/PUBLIC.KEY | sudo gpg --dearmour -o /usr/share/keyrings/rickslab-agent.gpg
```

* [Repository](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md#repository-installation) -
This approach is recommended for those interested in contributing to the project or helping to troubleshoot
an issue in realtime with the developer. This type of installation can exist alongside any of the other
installation types.

## User Guide

For a detailed introduction, a community sourced
[User Guide](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md)
is available. All tools are demonstrated and use cases are presented.  Additions
to the guide are welcome.  Please submit a pull request with your suggested additions!

## Commands

A summary of command line tools available in **rickslab-gpu-utils** follows. Additional
details are available in man pages and the
[User Guide](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md).

### gpu-chk

This utility verifies if the user's environment is compatible with **rickslab-gpu-utils**.

### gpu-ls

This utility displays most relevant parameters for installed and compatible GPUs. The
default behavior is to list relevant parameters by GPU.  OpenCL platform information is
added when the *--clinfo* option is used.  A brief listing of key parameters is available
with the *--short* command line option.  A simplified table of current GPU state is
displayed with the *--table* option. The *--no_fan* can be used to ignore fan settings.  The
*--pstate* option can be used to output the p-state table for each GPU instead of the list
of basic parameters.  The *--ppm* option is used to output the table of available
power/performance modes instead of basic parameters.  The *--features* option is used to output
the table of amdgpu pp features and their status instead of basic parameters.  The *--force_all*
results in an attempt to read all possible sensors, regardless of how the GPU is classified.  The
*--raw* will read all possible driver files and display with indicators of if a gpu-util key word
and description is associated with each file along with its contents.  The *--verbose* option
will display progress and informational messages generated by the utilities.  By default,
output data is formatted and color coded, so the *--no_markup* option can be specified
to get plain text.

### gpu-mon

A utility to give the current state of all compatible GPUs. The default behavior
is to continuously update a text based table in the current window until Ctrl-C is
pressed.  With the *--gui* option, a table of relevant parameters will be updated
in a Gtk window.  You can specify the delay between updates with the *--sleep N*
option where N is an integer > zero that specifies the number of seconds to sleep
between updates.  The *--no_fan* option can be used to disable the reading and display
of fan information.  The *--log* option is used to write all monitor data to a psv log
file.  When writing to a log file, the utility will indicate this in red at the top of
the window with a message that includes the log file name. The *--plot* will display a
plot of critical GPU parameters which updates at the specified *--sleep N* interval. If
you need both the plot and monitor displays, then using the --plot option is preferred
over running both tools as a single read of the GPUs is used to update both displays.
The *--ltz* option results in the use of local time instead of UTC.  The *--verbose* option
will display progress and informational messages generated by the utilities.

### gpu-plot

A utility to continuously plot the trend of critical GPU parameters for all compatible
GPUs. The *--sleep N* can be used to specify the update interval.  The *gpu-plot*
utility has 2 modes of operation.  The default mode is to read the GPU driver
details directly, which is useful as a standalone utility.  The *--stdin* option
causes *gpu-plot* to read GPU data from stdin.  This is how *gpu-mon* produces the
plot and can also be used to pipe your own data into the process.  The *--simlog*
option can be used with the *--stdin* when a monitor log file is piped as stdin.
This is useful for troubleshooting and can be used to display saved log results.
The *--ltz* option results in the use of local time instead of UTC.  If you plan
to run both *gpu-plot* and *gpu-mon*, then the *--plot* option of the *gpu-mon*
utility should be used instead of both utilities in order reduce data reads by
a factor of 2.  The *--verbose* option will display progress and informational messages
generated by the utilities.

### gpu-pac

Program and Control compatible GPUs with this utility.  By default, the commands to
be written to a GPU are written to a bash file for the user to inspect and run.  If you
have confidence, the *--execute_pac* option can be used to execute and then delete the
saved bash file.  Since the GPU device files are writable only by root, sudo is used to
execute commands in the bash file, as a result, you will be prompted for credentials in the
terminal where you executed *gpu-pac*. The *--no_fan* option can be used to eliminate
fan details from the utility. The *--force_write* option can be used to force all configuration
parameters to be written to the GPU.  The default behavior is to only write changes.  The
*--verbose* option will display progress and informational messages generated by the utilities.

## New in Development -  v3.8.4

* Nothing yet.

## Development Plans

* Add status read capabilities for Intel GPUs.  Need someone to provide `gpu-ls --raw --no_markup`
and `clinfo` output for Intel GPU.
* Add pac capabilities for Nvidia GPUs.

## Known Issues

* Seems like over/under clocking capabilities are disabled for Workstation cards.
* Reset of Curve Points for Vega20 (Radeon VII) does not work.
* Some windows do not support scrolling or resize, making it unusable for lower resolution installations.
* I/O error when selecting CUSTOM ppm.  Maybe it requires arguments to specify the custom configuration.
* Doesn't work well with Fiji ProDuo cards.
* P-state mask gets intermittently reset for GPU used as display output.
* Utility *gpu-pac* doesn't show what the current P-state mask is.  Not sure if that can be read back.
* Utility *gpu-pac* fan speed setting results in actual fan speeds a bit different from setting and pac
interface shows actual values instead of set values.
